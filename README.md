# ItemSwapper - Origins Inventory

This is an addon made to create compatibility between Origins' Inventory power (as seen on the Shulk origin) and ItemSwapper.

This should also work with any other mod that utilises Apoli's power system.

## License
This project is licensed under the GPL-3 license, just like the original ItemSwapper mod. Please keep this in mind when utilising code or when making a fork of this mod.

## Releases
There are no public releases for this addon at the moment as this mod was made before the ItemSwapper API was even a thing. This addon will have CurseForge and Modrinth releases once the API becomes a thing and it is rewritten.

If you really want to play with the addon right now, feel free build from source but I will not be officially supporting it until the mod gets a public release.

(Required on both Client and Server).
